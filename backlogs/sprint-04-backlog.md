# ðŸ“‹ Sprint 04 Backlog â€“ *Insurance Risk Calculator*

Scrum Master: Eric Pogue

Product Owner: Eric Pogue

Sprint 4 Planning Date/Time:

Sprint 4 Planning Participants: Eric Pogue, Tessy, and Edward Scissorhands (remotely)

Sprint 4 Backlog:

| **ID** | **User Story / Task** | **Priority (1-10)** | **Estimate (SP)** | **Spike (Y/N)** | **Status** | **Assigned** |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| RC-001 | As a Scrum Team, we want to identify the Sprint 4 Scrum Master and Product Owner so that I can ensure team responsibilities are clearly defined for the sprint, | 10 | 0 | Y | Done | Glaycon |
| RC-002 | As a Product Owner, I want to manage the backlogs and focus on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and prioritize stories so that I can deliver value to users by the end of the sprint. | 8 | 2 | Y | Ready | Glaycon |
| RC-003 | As a Scrum Master, I want to facilitate Sprint Planning and story commitment so that I can help the team work with focus and alignment. | 8 | 2 | Y | Ready | Andrew |

Todo:
1. Team members request the highest priority stories (required for MVP) 
2. These high-priority stories are assigned to the team member and **moved** from the Product Backlog to the Sprint 4 Backlog 
3. Team commits to Sprint 4 Backlog
